## Hi there

HETALION started on a fundamentally simple principle: to delegate only the intention of execution, rather than the underlying infrastructure.
Leveraging a portable and deterministic stack machine, the platform interprets instructions encoded as concise opcodes, transmitted via Kubernetes DNS, and executed seamlessly across a distributed network of nodes.

## Use Cases
- Distributed genetic computing
- Parallel evaluation of mathematical models
- Secure execution in edge environments

Coming Soon.
